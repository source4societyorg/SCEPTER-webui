# Usage

Works best with the [SCEPTER-Framework](https://www.github.com/source4societyorg/SCEPTER-Core) but can be used standalone in the same fashion of [react-boilerplate](https://www.github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) as well. Understanding react-boilerplate will give a better idea on how it is used, otherwise it is included automatically in SCEPTER whenever you initialize a web UI with the ui command (see [SCEPTER-Core README.md](https://www.github.com/source4societyorg/SCEPTER-Core) for the latest command documentation).

The difference between this repository and react-boilerplate is that many of the react-boilerplate scaffolding files have been turned into packages so that it is easier to build modular reusable components without referencing the underlying scaffolding, allowing for greater decoupling.
